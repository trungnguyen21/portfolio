# My (static) Portfolio homepage!

### Context:
[UBC](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/docs/setting-personal-website) provides personal space for hosting our own Website with the namespace `cs.ubc.ca` on an [Apache web server](https://httpd.apache.org/)! Who hates free VPS and a certified domain?


### Tech stack:
Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were all that I needed. Maybe some JS modules for animation and whatnot 🤷‍♂️
